First exercise
----
[Read this code](https://onlinegdb.com/YUoAhi4C3g).  
  
Do you understand it all?  

And, don't just read it, run it, too! That's what any code is meant to do.  

Can you fix the warning from the compiler?  

[Here is one solution](https://onlinegdb.com/Q1E47L1hQ).  

The same code is also under your 
["My Projects"](https://www.onlinegdb.com/myfiles)
folder.  
 
There, you can edit, improve, save and share it! But, make sure you are logged into you personal Google account.   

Now, improve it by reading more words from the user after the first prompt and use them intelligently in the first response to the user. You may need to learn more about std::cin and you can use Google AI to get that info 
[like here]( https://www.google.com/search?q=std+cin+c%2B%2B&mstk=AUtExfDS4xUz2CcBJ23oGKqLJwB4fNcWZbjlVvfAk6mrnZCj81aECSVkW3LnIpqyd92MtjtefO1sAn0GqM-ciwzDUYBDz0rKNtU4slNTrRuHdlEhvfvqxZFxX-5MisNMRDsZj7Y&csuir=3#vhid=zephyr:0&vssid=atritem-).  

Can you add some LLM tricks to help spice up your response? But, that's a master's level challenge for next year.  

Having fun now? Why not.
