First exercise
----
[Read this code](https://onlinegdb.com/Q1E47L1hQ).   
Do you understand it all?  

It's under your 
["My Projects"](https://www.onlinegdb.com/myfiles)
folder.  
There, you can edit and improve it! Do that by reading more words from the user after the first prompt and use them intelligently in the first response to the user. You may need to learn more about std::cin and you can use Google AI to get that info 
[like here]( https://www.google.com/search?q=std+cin+c%2B%2B&mstk=AUtExfDS4xUz2CcBJ23oGKqLJwB4fNcWZbjlVvfAk6mrnZCj81aECSVkW3LnIpqyd92MtjtefO1sAn0GqM-ciwzDUYBDz0rKNtU4slNTrRuHdlEhvfvqxZFxX-5MisNMRDsZj7Y&csuir=3#vhid=zephyr:0&vssid=atritem-).
